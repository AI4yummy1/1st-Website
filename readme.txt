Hello!

Welcome to my first ever HTML and Javascript project, I set my expectaions low but came out with good progress.

To recreate the lab that I used, I coded using Visual Studio with an extention called live server.
With the help of stack overflow, w3schools and the starting with html video, I created a website with all of the expectations met.
My website helps read my asset document and creates others, even though I was not able to complete that.
I really leaned a lot through out my project from the productive streaks to the annoying bugs and issues.


How To Insatall and used Live Server:

1. Open VS code
2. Click the extentions Tab
3. Type in live server
4. Right click on the project you would like to open with the live server
